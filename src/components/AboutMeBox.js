            Hello, my name is Jacob Welsh. As a committed senior at UNCC, 
            I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science, with a focus on Software Engineering. 
            My academic journey has allowed me to delve into various facets of computer science, 
            including robotics, cybersecurity, systems, and networking. 
            However, it is full-stack web development that has truly captivated my interest. 
            My current skill set includes proficiency in React, Express, Node.js, Flask, 
            MongoDB, Mongoose, and PostgreSQL. I am continually looking to expand my expertise and explore new horizons in the field.
